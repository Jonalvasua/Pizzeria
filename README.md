# Pizzeria
In this project, the client is opening a new pizzeria and has asked you to set up the ‘back-end’ by designing and building a SQL database for orders, staff and inventory data. Here are the 3 different dashboards so the client can monitor performance.

The main visualization is in Looker that depends on an instance of GCP (https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/5b7881a8-014b-4b64-b013-6cc12962bc96), in case the instance is stopped, please visualize the data in this other Looker link with local data (https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/917ca355-e4d3-4472-acfb-b89c9770f48c)
